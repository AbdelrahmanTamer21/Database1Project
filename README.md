# Advising System

This project is a comprehensive ASP.NET MVC and Web API application, demonstrating a robust and scalable approach to web development.  It provides a platform for students, advisors, and administrators to efficiently manage and track various aspects of the advising process. The application is designed with a focus on clean, maintainable code and follows industry-standard best practices. The project is organized into three main directories: Controllers, Models, and Views.

## Controllers

The Controllers directory is the heart of the application, orchestrating the flow of data between the Models and Views. Each controller corresponds to a specific area of functionality within the application. For instance, the `AdminController` is responsible for tasks related to administrative functions, such as user management and system configuration.

## Models

The Models directory is where the business logic resides. It contains classes that represent the data structures used in the application, encapsulating the rules and operations that can be performed on this data. These models are designed to be robust and flexible, allowing for easy modification and extension as the needs of the application evolve.

## Views

The Views directory is responsible for the presentation layer of the application. It contains templates that define how the data from the Models is rendered into HTML and presented to the user. These views are designed with a focus on user experience, ensuring that the interface is intuitive and responsive.
